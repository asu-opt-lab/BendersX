# Issues:
# 1. SplitOracle: Setting CPX_PARAM_EPRHS tightly (e.g., < 1e-6) results in dcglp terminating with ALMOST_INFEASIBLE --> set it tightly (1e-9) and outputs a typical Benders cut when dcglp is ALMOST_INFEASIBLE
# 2. SplitOracle: Setting zero_tol in solve_dcglp! large (e.g., 1e-4) results in disjunctive Benders with reuse_dcglp = true terminating with incorrect solution --> set it tightly as 1e-9
# 3. SplitOracle: solve_dcglp! becomes stall since the true violation should be multipled with omega_value[:z], which can be fairly small --> terminate dcglp when LB does not improve for a certain number of iterations
# 4. SplitOracle: the fat-knapsack-based disjunctive cut may have a sparse gamma_t, so adding only disjunctive cut does not improve lower bound, add_benders_cuts_to_master should be set at true

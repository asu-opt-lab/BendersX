A Julia implementation of disjunctive Benders decomposition algorithms for solving mixed-integer programming problems, developed as part of research on "Disjunctive Benders Decomposition".

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and computational experiments for disjunctive Benders decomposition methods. The implementation extends classical Benders decomposition by incorporating disjunctive cuts to improve convergence and solution quality for mixed-integer programming problems.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Algorithm Variants**: Implementation of sequential and callback-based Benders decomposition algorithms
- **Disjunctive Cuts**: Integration of disjunctive programming techniques for enhanced cut generation
- **Flexible Oracle System**: Modular oracle design supporting different subproblem types (typical, disjunctive, separable)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suite with multiple problem instances
- **Multiple Problem Types**: Support for facility location problems (UFLP, CFLP, SCFLP), network design (MCNDP), and other optimization problems

## Algorithm Implementations

### Core Algorithms
- `BendersSeq`: Sequential Benders decomposition
- `BendersSeqInOut`: Sequential variant with in-out technique
- `BendersBnB`: Branch-and-bound Benders decomposition  
- `Dcglp`: Split Cut Generating Linear Program
- `SpecializedBendersSeq`: Specialized sequential implementation

### Oracle Types
- `ClassicalOracle`: Traditional Benders subproblem oracle
- `KnapsackOracle`: Knapsack technique based oracle
- `SplitOracle`: Disjunctive programming-based oracle
- `SeparableOracle`: Oracle for separable subproblems

## Problem Examples

The `example/` directory contains implementations for several classic optimization problems featured in the paper:
- **UFLP**: Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem
- **SNIP**: Stochastic Network Interdiction Problem

We are actively developing this repository into a professional package. The following implementations are currently in progress:
- **CFLP**: Capacitated Facility Location Problem  
- **SCFLP**: Stochastic Capacitated Facility Location Problem
- **MCNDP**: Multi-Commodity Network Design Problem

## Installation

To set up the project:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

## Usage

We provide several scripts to run the algorithms on different problem instances. Please refer to the `scripts/` directory for more details.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
julia test/runtests.jl
```

Or run specific tests:
```bash
./test/runtests.sh
```

The test suite includes:
1. Sequential typical Benders decomposition
2. Sequential in-out typical Benders decomposition  
3. Sequential disjunctive Benders decomposition
4. Callback typical Benders decomposition
5. Callback disjunctive Benders decomposition
6. Specialized sequential Benders decomposition
